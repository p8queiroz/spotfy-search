Thank you for you application for the Compucorp Front End Engineer role.


Please complete both task 1 and task 2 from the document below. Please host your solutions if possible and send us links to both the hosted solution and github for the projects.


………………………………….


Task 1: Javascript: Music search
Description
* Build a simple HTML/JS app using Angular JS 1 which allows the user to search for an artist or album using the Spotify API ( https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) to get the results.
* Use a single combined field for searching both entities (like with google)
* You can chose how to display the results, but think about the best solution for the user experience. Ideally we would like to see some form of pagination/show more if the list is long but this is not essential 
* Bonus points for Typeahead searching would also be granted! 
* For artists listed in the results make these into a link that then displays the albums from that artist.
* Include some relevant information about the artist and/or albums in the results
Instructions
* The main focus of this activity is to access your JavaScript skills. Therefore, style the app appropriately using your own judgement
* Upload the completed project to your Github account, and send us a link
* If you can host the app without expense please do
* Structure your code to be clean, efficient and maintainable
* Write appropriate front end tests for you app (essential)
* Use of design patterns would be a plus
* Use of caching and local storage would be a plus
* Anything else that could make us say wow!

Please build the front end HTML and CSS structure for the site so that the backend developer can convert this to a functioning site.


The site should be responsive and it is proposed that each “pane” should resize fit the screen that it is displayed on.


* Do not use any CSS framework (i.e. Bootstrap, Foundation, or similar)
* You may use libraries such as icon packs (font-awesome etc)
* Make your best judgement on font files
* The site should work fine with the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge and with IE11
* The site must be responsive and you should use your own judgement for breakpoints and adaptations for other screen sizes
